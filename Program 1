Output

What comes to our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us. The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion, and man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God. Worship is pure of base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God. 
There are 376 letters
There are 68 words
